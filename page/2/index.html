          I’ve been wanting to do another jam for awhile. I like the two week cycle, but haven’t seen any themes or jams that really struck my fancy. The technical limitations ones went well in the past, so those are the ones I tend to go after.
This time, it was a 1-bit (black and white graphics) clicker (mouse only) jam. Perfect! My idea was to go after something that was a little bit like Spaceplan or a cookie clicker-esque game.

          I finished another jam, this time making oneshot!
What Is It It’s a little arena-y shooter thing, I guess? 2-4 people jump around in a little room and try to shoot each other. Everyone only gets one bullet before having to scramble for another one.
What Went Right Finished! It’s done, and playable, and doesn’t seem to blow up! Kudos, me.
Simple! I stuck to the bounds of the theme, once again bolstered by a technical, rather than creative, limitation.

          There’s an incredibly common, useful design paradigm called ‘target-action’, one I first encountered on iOS. Basically, you’ve got a button that calls a function when something specific happens: maybe a touch or a drag or something. This is the basis of all of iOS’ user input.
So I thought it’d be handy to recreate something similar using the entity-component model. It’s pretty braindead-simple, but it seems to work okay for my purposes.

          I didn’t expect to write more of these, but here I am! I wanted to document a bit of interesting behavior I found in the process of building/rebuilding a shmup.
I had this cool effect for making a sprite kind of flicker and glow a bit by adding a duplicate and making it expand and contract rapidly. I think the old way in SpriteKit used a parent/child relationship with an SKAction for the animation.

          I’m not dead! A shock, I know, but between real-life obligations and a decline in my general state of gives-a-crap, my fun little hobby life has suffered in recent months. Shucks.
Doesn’t mean I can’t bounce back, though, right? Spring 2015-ish, I was on the hunt for something new to tinker with, and I found this rad stuff.
First off, a dumb, semi-obvious one. For anyone loading textures in config, using something like config.
