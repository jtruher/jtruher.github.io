          Like a lot of indies and hobbyists, I play around with a lot of prototypes. Most of the time, these don’t see the light of day, and for good reason - they’re generally awful. It’s occurred to me more and more recently, though, that the cone of shamesilence might be more appropriate for, say, Apple, and less appropriate for someone nobody’s heard of.
So with that in mind, I thought it’d be a fun exercise to share some of my less-awful fiddlings, on the off-chance that someone finds them interesting.

          Automatic App Update is one of the new headline features in iOS 7. Part of me is thrilled, particularly as a developer - now, I’m less likely to wonder whether a customer is running the latest version of my software. Sure, that particular class of defects is still going to be something to consider, but now it’ll hopefully be less prevalent.
A snooty part of my personality, though, wondered how necessary it was.

          New Years’ Resolutions, by and large, are a crock of shit. Most people who make them don’t follow them, and they’re just a fantastic source of guilt for just about everyone. Boring. Write about something else.
This year, instead of making resolutions I won’t keep, I’m just trying to passively do little things that’ll help me as I go. One of the things that took me nearly two weeks to notice was a brief nightly journal.

What do I actually want to get done in 2013? Basically, the same plans as 2012 - it’d be nice to actually make something and send it out into the world to get ripped apart. This year, though, I’ve got some new ideas and some different plans.
For one thing, I’ve been working on something based on an odd idea I had over the summer.

          I’ve been playing around a bit with a few little iOS apps, and one of the annoying things I’ve come across is how rotation is handled: specifically, how it isn’t quite handled by your views. It is, from a certain point of view, just fine, but from another, it’s completely nuts.
Every UIView has what’s called a transform - the linear algebra explanation is that it’s a 3x3 matrix that mucks about with your UIView’s box in 3d-space.
