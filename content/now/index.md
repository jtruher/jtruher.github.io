Here's what's occupying my time right now, inspired by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/) and [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/).

### Games

* Assassin's Creed: Black Flag.  Ahoy!  It's pretty fun.  I like exploring and wandering around.

### Hobbies

* Finishing up a [lowresjam game](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam2016) because it sounded fun!  That lives [here now!](http://jtruher.itch.io/lzrs)
* Building a shmup one chunk at a time in luxe
* Planning out a few old mechanics as their own games
* Reinvestigating older apps for updates
