[{{< image src="/img/the-dungeon-icon.png" alt="The Dungeon" position="left" style="border-radius: 8px;float:left; margin: 10px" >}}](/the-dungeon) The Dungeon is both my first game and my first iOS project.  It's a remake/homage of a classic Macintosh roguelike, The Dungeon of Doom.  My goal was to bring that same kind of frantic fun to a modern platform while, hopefully, preserving what made that game unique and memorable.  It's a dungeon crawler in the truest sense of the word, as there's no place else to go - just forty floors of radical monster stomping.

[{{< image src="/img/panic-attack-icon.png" alt="Panic Attack" position="right" style="border-radius: 8px;float:right; margin: 10px" >}}](/panic-attack) Panic Attack is my second game, a remake of the mechanics of Tetris Attack for the SNES, though was also strongly influenced by [Crack Attack](http://www.aluminumangel.org/attack/).  It's got local two-player head to head on iPad and multiplayer support on iOS using Game Center.  It's got bright, shiny graphics and a pretty rockin' soundtrack, too.
