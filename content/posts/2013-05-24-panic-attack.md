[Panic Attack](/panic-attack) is out!

Which is pretty neat.  It's kind of weird thinking that, like, 3 years ago, I didn't really have a whole lot going on.  3 years ago, this October, I pushed an app that people seemed to like, which was a little staggering.  It wasn't exactly an easy time, but it was easier than it is now.  It's easy to get overwhelmed by the flood of competitors.

The remarkable thing to me is how little competition there *actually* is - when the choice is a buck here or there, a lot of the economics of the $60 game just kind of fall apart.  At $60, yeah, you had to choose between JumbleFight and MarvelCapcom2k3, but at a buck or two, why not get, like, every game in a genre?  Hell, I probably spent more on lunch today than it'd take me to buy every single roguelike on iOS.

That's not to say I'm completely blaming the store for being steamrolled - heavens, no!  It's possible to get attention, but I think (yet to be proven, here) that it takes persistence, volume (both loud and lots), and, well, a bit of luck.  At least that hasn't changed too much.

The last post on here was about setting and maintaining habits.  I wrote that from a position of trying to keep momentum going in order to finish a project, but I'm starting to think there's value in a different kind of momentum.  I sort of model myself off of Apple - never showing something to anyone before it's really ready to be seen, but I'm no longer sure if that's the right move or not.  It's worth thinking about, at least.
