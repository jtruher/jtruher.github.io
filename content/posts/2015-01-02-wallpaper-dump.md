One of the things that I ended up doing for Wallomatic was needing to dump a whole lot of random variations with one particular generator to make sure that stuff looked pretty okay in a lot of different circumstances.  Debug builds have a snazzy little button that dumps 40 random renders in a row straight to disk, with half having lines enabled and the other half disabled.  I'd dump them, push them up to imgur, then show them off to friends to see what they thought.

It occurred to me that, hey, why not share these with everyone?  With that in mind, here're a bunch of album links after the page break.
