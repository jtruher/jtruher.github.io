 - *Sailor Carbon Nano Black.*  This, so far, is my favorite black.  The Montblanc Blue-Black is a close second, but it's a bit too faint, and really more like a pale gray in comparison.  It's black.  Like, really, really super dark.  It's heard of reflecting light and wants no part in it.  This is the ink that has a permanent home in my Safari.  I worry about putting it in non-sturdy pens, as it's a suspension, not a solution.  This means, in addition to being a liquid, it's also got little tiny particles of mega-black floating in it.  It also means that this is the only ink I have to give a good, vigorous shake before refilling a pen.
 - *Ku-jaku, Iroshizuku.*
 - *Tsuki-yo, Iroshizuku.* 
 - *Ajisai, Iroshizuku.* I think this was the first Iroshizuku ink I tried.  Really pretty color.  They all are, really.  Uh.  

There's a box of other inks that I might - might - end up getting to someday.  The nice thing about a lot of these is that it takes kind of a long time to get through a bottle.  It's great if you've got a color you like, but less so if you're not so fond of a particular shade.  A lot of ink sellers will do variety packs or samplers. [Goulet Pens](http://www.gouletpens.com/Shop_All_Ink_Samples_s/976.htm) is a pretty reputable place for buying any of this stuff.
