I made a game for  [Ludum Dare 39](https://ldjam.com), this time making [Laser Dodgy](https://jtruher.itch.io/ld39)!

Deja vu, right?

### What Is It?


#### What Went Right

*The Usual*

It finished, which is great, and stuck to the theme of the jam.  Go me!

*Silly*

Playing it is actually pretty fun and goofy.  It's a silly little timewaster.

#### What Maybe Kinda Didn't Go Great

*The Name*

Flappy Joust is not something I can claim on the iOS App Store, alas!  I'll need to think of something better if I want to publish it - which I think I might.

#### Final Thoughts

I'm pretty happy with it.  It's a goofy, silly time-waster.  Does it have much long-term appeal?  Maybe not, but it might be fun for a few people to dink around with.
