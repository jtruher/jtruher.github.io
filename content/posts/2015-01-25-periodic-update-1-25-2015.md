Shoot!  It's 11PM, and I nearly forgot to do my weekly progress update!

This week was spent giving Bullet Heck a lot of polish and effort.  I improved performance a bit by pushing stuff onto the background and totally redid how audio works.  Anyone who thinks they can ship a straight-up, boring SpriteKit game with just the stuff they give you is...well, not me, apparently.  I was pleased that the stuff I wrote for Panic Attack slid over pretty easily.  It all uses ObjectAL (which is just a wrapper over OpenAL - mostly) so sound hums along happily.

I had the bright idea to test the game on the train one commute home, and boy howdy, did I see a lot of silly little things - things I've fixed!  Mostly!  There are still a few little lingering dumb UI things, but it's getting closer to 'done'.  Why all the work?  Well, there's a Pitch Party thing this Wednesday, and I was looking forward to showing it off a bit.

I also spent a very, very small amount of time twiddling with a little prototype idea.  Basically, it's sorta-kinda like pong, except with shooting balls?  I don't know, we'll see if it goes anywhere.
