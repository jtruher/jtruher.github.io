Starting new projects always feels great.  Pure possibility, stretching out 
forever!  Think of all of the awesome things you'll get to make!  This'll be 
the best, well, whatever, because you won't make any of the mistakes that other 
people have, or you'll build something even better than your predecessors, 
by borrowing here, copying there, polishing everywhere.  

Then, reality sets in.  Oh, *shit*, I'm going to have to build *what*?  Where 
in the hell do I even start?  The whole list is just too damned big!  Where 
do I even start?

Start small, start anywhere, but please, just freakin' start.
