This week was another brisk one.  I spent a bit of time hammering at the asteroids in Bullet Heck to make them a bit more sensible and a bit more game-y.  Just having a constant, endless wave of asteroids is a bit exhausting so I'm setting them up to do occasional bursts based on the asteroid density of that particular wave.

I also did a bit of work on Wallomatic this week, adding a neat blur filter toggle.  I'm always leery about adding twiddlers and settings, but this one feels like a keeper.  It was all pretty much inspired by how OS X blurs your wallpaper at the login prompt, so I have Apple to thank!  Yay.

I'm still kinda thumping away at learning luxeengine/snowkit and that whole constellation of rad stuff.  There's an Art/Code night this Thursday that I'm hoping to have something playable and pokable, but we'll see how it goes.  There's not *that* much stuff to build, but I've got kind of a busy week ahead of me.
