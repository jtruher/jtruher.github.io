Well, it's been a long time, hasn't it?  I suppose that writing on here more 
would be a great start for a resolution.  At least two posts a month, preferably 
one a week, and finally finish that damnable post-mortem, too!  And, hey, while 
we're dreaming big, this seems like as good a time as any to talk future plans 
for actual App Store stuff, and not just this silly (but necessary) community 
feedback stuff.

(As another aside - how weird is that?  I have a community?  I'll believe it 
when I see it!)

So, first off, let's talk current apps.  The Dungeon recently had a sale over 
the New Years break, which was pretty great!  Lots of new players, too, which 
always makes me smile.  The leaderboards broke a thousand players, too, which 
was also really great.  Honestly, I didn't even know if we'd ever break a hundred! 
 Hell, for that matter, I wasn't even sure if there'd ever even be *leaderboards* 
at all!

To me, The Dungeon's already been a pretty great success.  I learned a ton 
about the platform, some of the pitfalls, how to handle/manage marketing, and 
a bunch of other stuff along the way.  I'd always assumed that the development 
would be the bigger effort, and once it was out there, whew, job's over, but 
in hindsight, that was really friggin' stupid.  I'm looking forward to the 
next app (or two) being smoother, but more on that later.

The real question is: what's next?  The list isn't exactly getting smaller, 
but I'm getting to the (dangerous) point now where I'm much more interested 
in moving on to something bigger and better, rather than stay behind to maintain 
the current product.  There have been a ton of feature requests, but I've shied 
away from doing more or less all of them, due to their general nature.  This 
app, at its core, is meant to be as close as possible to the original Dungeon 
of Doom, while still making sense for the iOS platform.  That said, I think 
that, apart from bug fixes and a few other things (like Achievements, in all 
likelihood), The Dungeon is more or less complete.  I'll be going over the 
big-long-list, just to make sure I haven't forgotten anything, but unless I 
hear otherwise, it is more or less a wrap.

That's not to say that I'm going to just be sitting on my thumbs, of course. 
 Soon-ish, I'll have more up here, announcing the next big thing(s).  And, 
hey, just because The Dungeon might be over, doesn't mean that the world itself 
is done and sewn up.  There's plenty that can be done in there to make it way, 
way, way cooler!  But that, sadly, is for another day!

Here's looking at a wonderful, exciting, productive 2011!
