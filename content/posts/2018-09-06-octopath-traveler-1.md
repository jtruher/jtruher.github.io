One of my favorite silliest parts of this game revolves around Olberic, a brave knight.  Each playable character has their own way of interacting with the world around them.  The nice priest lady can guide people through life, the trader can buy stuff off of people, and the knight -

Well.  The knight can walk up to random fools, challenge them to a duel, and beat the everloving shit out of them.

It’s maybe one of my favorite mechanics in this game, particularly with how I’ve got him configured.  You can mix and match what subclasses characters get, and I’ve thrown Thief at him.

Thief is a little broken in single-target.  You can steal health and energy, which is already broken, but you do it with this fast little double-jab.

The bravest knight in the land is running around, challenging people to duels, then running up and stabbing them repeatedly.

I don’t think this is a great game, but I’m having a lot of fun playing it for silly shit like this.

Also, the music is really pretty great!
