This is something I've been kind of noodling about for awhile and it's gonna be a bit of a ramble.  And before I even start, I might as well ramble: sometimes I feel like this is all just catharsis for the writer or some kind of incredible self-own.  I don't know.

Okay!  Let's try this again.  Games have data, like levels and whatnot.  If you're not going the procedural generation route - and maybe even if you are - that data's gotta come from somewhere.  The first stab is usually just something done by hand.  I've done this in the past, and it's fine, but can be kind of crummy in a few ways.

Engineers like to stamp out inherent crumminess.  Sometimes their solutions suck if the problem isn't stated as accurately as necessary.  For this case, one of the problems was having to rewrite/adjust a whole bunch of data if, say, you want to add a field.  That sucks!  Doing JSON
