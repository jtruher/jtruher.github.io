Because [this](/blog/2012/01/19/2012-plans-goals/) went so well, it seemed like a good idea to take a look through last year's as I start to think about what to do this year.  In no particular order, they were basically:

	* Ship The Dungeon 2.0
	* Mac version of TD?
	* Make a Not-Game
	* Write more

Woof.  One out of, uh, four ain't bad, right?  If nothing else, there's room for improvement, and to be fair, the 2.0 update (and .0.1 and .0.2) ended up being pretty damned big.  It's almost gotten to the point where I'm not completely ashamed of it, either, so that's bonus awesome.

The Mac version ended up being a bit of a quagmire, and interest petered out pretty quickly.  It really is better suited for a quick, 30 second play experience, not the kind of deep game that most desktop players are accustomed to.

The Not-Game projects both petered out as well due to lack of interest, as did writing more.  This started to pick up a little as I switched away from Posterous and over towards this static site thing with Octopress (couldn't you tell?)  I'd like to write more, because I really do enjoy it.  I've got a few things that've needed doing for a few months now, but am finally hitting a stride where things are actually being accomplished on a night-to-night basis.

That's not to say I'm disappointed with how 2012 went.  It was kind of a colossal year, with a huge change right near the end.  I prototyped a few things, one of which is still being developed, and deserves its own little chunk of space.  All done looking backwards now - time to look ahead.  Woof!
