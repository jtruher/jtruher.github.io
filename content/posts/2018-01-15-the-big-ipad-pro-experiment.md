I’ve enjoyed the iPad pretty much since it came out, warts and all.  I’ve had a series of them bought for me by other people: a 1st gen by a friend, who wanted one of my games on it, and a 3rd gen (first retina!) was a combo birthday/father’s day gift.  I got myself a 2nd gen Mini which I still assert has a pretty great form factor.  I’m going to be bummed out if they end up killing that size.

I’ve also been interested in the whole Pro line of iPads pretty much since those came out, too.  It seemed like a pretty great idea: faster internals, bigger screen, pen input.  As someone who’s had delusions of mediocrity for ages as far as art goes, it had its appeals: a better, simpler cintiq, basically.




One of the things I noticed once I downloaded Procreate was that it had streaming features, which seemed both neat and a little strange.  


I only have a few minor complaints about this thing.  Sometimes, they keyboard gets stuck and the command key won’t work.  Tabbing between apps usually fixes it.  Also, the narrow bezel is occasionally super duper annoying.  I’ll reach up to grab the top of the thing and ever-so-gently graze the status bar, flinging me to the top of whatever content I’m looking at.  It’s obnoxious in some apps and downright terrible in others.  I’m a twitter completionist (re: masochist)  so when Tweetbot loses my place, it’s a bit maddening.

Silly streaming setup?
