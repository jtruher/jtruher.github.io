Pixatronic is a little weird at first glance so it seemed like a good idea to write down how I make it draw cool stuff, and how I have fun with it.

One thing I found really useful was, honestly, to just play around with the thing.  Put down a random squiggle, hit render, then edit based on what I saw and what I liked.  If I had a goal in mind, I might put down a rough shape and then carve or fill with different colors as I went.

{{< image src="/img/creepface.png" position="right" style="border-radius: 8px; float:right; margin: 10px; width:48px;height:48px;" >}}
<!-- {-% img iconimage right /images/creepface.png 48 48 %} -->

One important thing to note is that not all colors are created equal.  Black will always show up on the other side, while red, green and blue have a chance to be an "empty" pixel, instead.  This can be a good way to add a bit of randomness to your art.
