So I use octopress as a blogging engine, which is whatever.  It takes markdown, spits out html, and everyone’s happy.  I like keeping it to simple text files that I can fling around and edit just about anywhere.  Truthfully, this is more or less how I do game dev stuff, too - nothing complicated like UE4 or Unity, just text that gets compiled (with art/sound assets being built elsewhere, naturally).  This means that making links and embedding images into posts is a bit of a chore, but doable.  

It’s also got a little previewed that you can run (`rake preview`, naturally), that spins up a little webserver to view the content.  This means I can leave the previewer running on my mac and just hit `hostname.local:4000` to preview from my iPad
