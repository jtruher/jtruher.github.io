what're my actual thoughts about tetris 99?  well i guess for years i didn't really care about tetris, mostly because (in truth) i kinda suck at it.  i am not, as they say, a tetris wizard, so the thought of playing against 98 other people simultaneously didn't strike me as particularly appealing.

Free games, though?  Those're always appealing, and so Tetris 99 I have played.

I expected it'd be Tetris because that's what it says on the box, duh, but I didn't expect to actually enjoy it.

There's really very little Gameâ„¢ there, in all honesty.  You've got Battle Royale mode, and that's it, and yet I find myself coming back for another round, just to see how I do.  Winning or losing kind of doesn't matter - the little individual mechanics are what I find entertaining, regardless of what anyone else is doing.
