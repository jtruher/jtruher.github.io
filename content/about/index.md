Half-Bit Software started in January of 2010, when a great deal of spare time was suddenly thrust upon me.  I began working on The Dungeon and, ten months later, managed to ship something that wasn't complete garbage.  This trend has largely continued to the present day, with each successive app less disappointing than the last.
