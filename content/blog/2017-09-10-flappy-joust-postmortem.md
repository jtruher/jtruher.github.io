I finished another [jam](http://itch.io/jam/one-button-to-rule-all-jam), this time making [Flappy Joust](http://jtruher.itch.io/flappy-joust)!

Deja vu, right?

### What Is It?

Flappy Joust is an amalgam of Flappy Bird and Joust/Glypha III, minus some of the collision death mechanics.  In Joust, you ride ostriches around an arena, trying to poke enemies with your spear.  In Flappy Bird, you tap to flap and try to avoid touching anything.  This drops the death-by-touching mechanic and removes movement controls, giving players one action: flap, which makes the player move faster and bounce upwards slightly.

#### What Went Right

*The Usual*

It finished, which is great, and stuck to the theme of the jam.  Go me!

*Silly*

Playing it is actually pretty fun and goofy.  It's a silly little timewaster.

#### What Maybe Kinda Didn't Go Great

*The Name*

Flappy Joust is not something I can claim on the iOS App Store, alas!  I'll need to think of something better if I want to publish it - which I think I might.

#### Final Thoughts

I'm pretty happy with it.  It's a goofy, silly time-waster.  Does it have much long-term appeal?  Maybe not, but it might be fun for a few people to dink around with.
