I've been sick all week, so this'll be brief.  More churn and minor improvements to The Dungeon's codebase.  There's a lot of stupid to pick through.  I also remembered something I really wanted to add to Panic Attack's game over screen.  The Dungeon was smart, because it let you share your score with the world.  Crossy Road does this, too.  Panic Attack ought to.

Most of the semi-productive time this week was spent thinking and improving Bullet Heck.  It's got a few little bugs that ought to be squashed before I show it off to more people, and one thing in particular I'd like to add are environmental hazards.  (Those are my favorite.)

I'm also spinning up a little bit of time on a hero generator idea that Will from PIGSquad pitched at me.  It's pretty early yet, but it'll probably be pretty cool and funny.
