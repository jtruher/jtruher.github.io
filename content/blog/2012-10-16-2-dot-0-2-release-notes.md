The 2.0.2 was submitted last night.  I decided to do the app store update in limerick form and post a more detailed list here.

 - Potions now give a little bit of hunger back, depending on difficulty level.
 - The twitter button on the main menu now redirects to halfbitsoftware.com because I'm certain nobody cares about @halfbitsoftware.
 - Minor Twitter text formatting bug fixed.
 - Removed a few megs of unused images and compressed existing images.
 - Added retina splash screen
 - Fixed view screen bug.
 - Wizards now start with more wand charges to make the early game a bit more fair.
 - Animation fix on wand blasts.
 - Fixed minor high scores list issue.
 - Fixed empty name error.
