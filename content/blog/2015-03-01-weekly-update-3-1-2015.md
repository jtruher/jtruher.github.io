This week, I did a bit more work on both Bullet Heck and my luxe evaluation.  I was a little bummed out by the wiimote not being a good controller for luxe's gamepad support, but I've got some spare 360 controllers that seem to do great.  When I carve out the time I'm going to try to do a kind of physics-based arena Marble Madness kind of...thing.  It's still pretty nebulous but I think I've got enough of a hook that I should be able to fake something up.

There was a game demo event thing on Monday that went pretty well.  Got a lot of stuff done on Bullet Heck just before, mostly adding text and story snippets.  I also managed to fix a long-standing annoyance with the way controls worked.  They've been kinda stupid and broken for awhile so it feels really good to get them in a confident state.

That was pretty much this week.  Someday I'll be done, though I'm a bit terrified to write out the full and complete ship-task-list.  Those are usually pretty disheartening experiences.  Don't forget - when your game's mechanics are done, you're nowhere near done!
