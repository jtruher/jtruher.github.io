I feel like I don't post here nearly enough, particularly given some of the 
total schlock I've been reading on other blogs.  So, with that in mind, a quick 
look back at the first year of being a Real Indie Dude™ seemed like a good 
use of time, and a good excuse to post about what my future plans are, too. 

One year ago, my first app went on sale.  After the initial wave of giddiness 
wore off, I was left with a state of mild shock.  People were actually playing 
the game, and seemed to be enjoying it.  I took some of the initial feedback 
and, a few weeks later, pushed out an update.  A few weeks after that, I pushed 
out another, though both were pretty minor.

After this, I started plotting out what I wanted to do next.  The problem with 
The Dungeon is that I was building against an existing feature set, i.e., the 
original Mac game.  I didn't want to add anything that would violate the spirit 
or intent of the earlier work, which was both a hindrance and a help.  It was 
nice to limit the scope of things, but it also kept me from doing some neat 
stuff (like character abilities, for example).

Given these limitations, in early 2011, I started planning out what I wanted 
to do next.  The Dungeon had really terrible combat math, so I wanted to plot 
out a better system of actions and abilities, and figured out a way to turn 
that thing into something that resembled a game.  I fiddled around with a music 
player, too, due to dissatisfaction with the built-in iPod app.  I also got 
a good chunk of the way through feature-complete on a grocery list app.  I 
even started planning and writing a sequel to The Dungeon, with the intent 
of fixing all of the things I hated about that game.  A friend tried to coax 
me into doing the October Game Jam thingie, so I plotted out how to do a sort 
of stealth puzzler which (thankfully) did not get very far.

Doing a bit of mac development was also becoming more interesting to me.  I 
wanted to write something that sat somewhere between the Finder and Terminal, 
in terms of features and friendliness.  A friend also wants a halfway decent 
iTunes replacement, so that goes on the pile o' stuff, too.

Anyone with any project management skills is already shaking their heads and 
clucking their tongues.  "You're one guy, you idiot!  You've spread yourself 
too thin!"  And, duh, I had.  Obviously, I had, no shit.  That laundry list 
could probably keep my nights and weekends busy for years to come, assuming 
my magpie sensibilities don't get in the way.

So, really, what's the punchline?  What does this mean for Half-Bit?  Am I 
scaling back, shutting down shop, or full-steam-aheading?  Well, to start, 
I'm definitely going to pick and choose my projects more carefully, add them 
to the big-ass list, and work my ass off to only keep one or two things in 
the queue.  Any more than that, and nothing'll ever finish.

And, with all of that word vomit, I'm naturally not going to do any of the 
stuff listed above (sort of).  I feel incredibly grateful to The Dungeon - 
it was a great experience, it seemed reasonably successful (depending on your 
definition), and, hell, it bounced my career in a completely new, exciting 
direction, which is why I'm currently working on Universalizing the app.  I've 
got a pretty decent feature set in mind, too, that'll probably deserve its 
own post.

As that's happening, and when I just can't take anymore Goddamned Photoshop, 
I'll probably work on aggressively pushing the grocery list app out the door. 
 It's more or less just my attempt at making something that isn't a complete 
design catastrophe, but if someone finds it useful for a buck, then that'll 
put a smile on my face, too.

When that's done. . .woof.  We'll just have to see!
