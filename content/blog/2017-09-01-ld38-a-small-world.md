I finally managed to actually do a Ludum Dare!  [A Small World](http://jtruher.itch.io/ld38)

### What Is It?

"A Small World" was the theme for Ludum Dare 38, a weekend gamejam/competition from the third week of April 2017.  

#### What Went Right

#### What Went Horribly Wrong

#### What Did I Learn

Mostly?  That it was okay to go with something super duper scaled back.  There's very little 'game' here in the traditional sense.  It's more like one of those hoity toity Game as Art things.  I mostly deal with mechanics and try to build up from there, seeing what falls out.  This was more based around the idea of being very small and very alone, and realizing just how much of both you were.

#### Final Thoughts
