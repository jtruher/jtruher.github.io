Whoa.  Two weeks in a row?  I'm on a roll!

So!  The holidays happened, which were good!  We're not gonna talk about that.

We're gonna talk about progress and what I've been up to.  A kindly soul contacted me awhile ago on Facebook saying that, er, the audio in The Dungeon was not great.  He's pretty much 100% correct - and better still, offered to contribute new stuff for it!  Not being a complete nitwit, I accepted.

This means, of course, that the time has come for a fairly big update to the game.  This is a hobby, but one I take fairly seriously in certain ways.  This is a great opportunity to update for the new phone sizes and new iOS updates.  I'm planning on bumping the minimum version to 7.0 just to reduce the amount of hair pulled from my head.  I'd love to go straight to 8.0 but I'm not sure I can get away with that, sadly.

I'm also going to do a bump for Panic Attack at the same time, since a lot of the updates/deprecations/warnings/code improvement efforts will apply to both products.  It's going to be a boatload of work but it ought to be worth it, in the end.  In terms of sales, Panic Attack was pretty much a dud, so that one might end up moving to 8.0 just so I have less to maintain/worry about.

Because stats are fun, here's some output from cloc for both Panic Attack and The Dungeon!

There's plenty of open-source stuff in there, but fwhoosh, that's a lot of stuff to check over and improve.  Panic Attack, at least, is recent enough to be in a not-too-tortured state.  Pray for Mojo.
