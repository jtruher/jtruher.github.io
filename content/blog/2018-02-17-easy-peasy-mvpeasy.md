An MVP, or minimum-viable product, for you hoidy toidy bizdev folks, is the smallest thing that could possibly exist to tell you whether you’re building the right thing.  With a game, this might be a low fidelity prototype, with no art or sound assets, just basic input and mechanics.  For a web service, maybe that’s a simple API that you can poke at.

Regardless of what you’re building, it boils down to a fundamentally different philosophy: there’s nothing that needs to be maintained with an MVP, and you’re generally sacrificing the future to validate some present vision.  It’s tough to reconcile this, particularly if you’ve got pride in your work.  MVPs are inherently temporary - though, granted, you can build one that isn’t totally throwaway spaghetti garbage.
