. . .I can be a real idiot.  Take my music player idea, for example.  Apple 
exposes a ton of pretty solid apis to access a user's iPod library.  No write 
access, of course, which is kind of a bummer, but it's better than nothing. 
 And it's got some clever-ish iterators, giving you representative slices of 
filterable attributes, like artist and album.  Which works great - unless your 
music isn't necessarily organized as perfectly as it could be.  Like, say, 
for instance, if your album artwork is only on the first and last track of 
an album, but it decides that the representative track should be somewhere 
in the middle.  D'oh!





That said, work on whatever I end up calling the music app is going pretty 
well.  I've got the general look and feel more or less settled, and I'm currently 
building up the UI and flow.  Something I found really cool when doing The 
Dungeon was to take lots of screenshots as I went, mostly just to share with 
friends and family.  This time, I think I'm going to do the same thing, only 
to a (slightly) larger audience.





With that in mind, here's some neat screenshots!







Also, to those of you with sharp eyes, you might notice some of the albums 
don't have artwork show up.  It's an interesting non-bug with the iPod Library 
access stuff.  There's a neat method you can use when iterating over music 
collections, where it'll pick a track in particular as a faster means of iteration. 
 Unfortunately, if, say, you've only got the first and last tracks of an album 
with album artwork, and it chooses the third as a representative item, then 
you'll be boned, and not get to see any artwork.  Bummer!





(Also, please don't make fun of my bad taste in music.  I'm, er, putting a 
diverse collection on there for, uh, research and thoroughness.  That's my 
story, and I'm sticking with it. :)
