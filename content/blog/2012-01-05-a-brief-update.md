Welcome to 2012!

Progress has been pretty strong on the next update for The Dungeon.  The universalification 
(not a word) has been going really well, and things feel pretty great on the 
larger device.

 

If you're not following me on twitter ([@jtruher][1]), what's the hold up? 
 I've been posting near-daily progress screens, and if there's something interesting 
and visual, I'll totally toss it up on there.  Based on some blogosphere brou-hah-hah, 
I've been tempted to turn off comments, but if you'd like to get in touch with 
me (and are not a spammer), Twitter is definitely the right place to go.
