yearly churn - angry about churn?

angry about limitations?
angry all the time, at dumb things?

I'm a bit of a coward.  Okay, fine - I'm a pretty big one.  If I make something, it's usually a sign that some better, tougher emotion rose up to shout my fear into the corner, whether by anger, or excitement, or even greed.  The Dungeon happened because I really wanted to make something - ditto Panic Attack.  Pixatronic happened because I was pissed off at Angraxian, which, goddamnit, still hasn't happened yet.  Wallomatic is largely a result of curiosity, though I'll be damned if there isn't a bit of mad floating around in there due to how much longer it took than I'd expected.

But the problem here is that most of the chunks for each aren't these big, massive jumps along the way.  Each is a sort of half-step forward, half-step to the side.  For the most part, I'm playing it safe with all of them, except for the first one, where *everything* was new and exciting, back when the iPad was brand new.

The problem here is that I'm bored.  It happens, especially to me.  I can't keep doing the same kind of thing, over and over again.  I'll lose my mind, and not in a fun way, either.  Fear over releasing something that *really* sucks is winning over interest in doing something new, or trying to figure out a neat way to make something rad.

I know I'm not the only one pissed right now at how fast things are changing.  It's one thing to have improvements, but it's another entirely to have brand-new crap year after year.  Insult is lumped onto injury when the new stuff never seems to work quite right.
