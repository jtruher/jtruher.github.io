[Don’t buy the MacBook Pros even on sale, in my opinion | The Outline](https://theoutline.com/post/4277/dont-buy-the-new-macbook-pros-even-on-sale-in-my-opinion?zd=1&zi=56xsnavs)

So, that doesn’t seem great, does it?  I really, really want to like that keyboard, I promise.  I like the clicky feel of it, short-throw keys are my jam, I could even get used to the narrower gaps between keys.
 
(Don’t get me started on the inverted-T.)

But the reliability issues are maddening - key’s that would double fire, or not fire at all, or only fire at a particular angle or from a particular spot.  C’mon, that’s no way for a computer to be.

So, like Casey Johnston, I sold my 2016 MacBook Pro and threw that money at an iMac Pro.  So far?  It’s [completely knocking my socks off.](https://twitter.com/jtruher/status/989326545381543936)
