It seemed like a neat idea to do a kind of public log of LD29 progress.  I'm definitely not doing the main competition, and barely doing the jam.  Largely, it's an excuse to try to do something neat on a really cramped time-table.

**4/25/2014, 12PM.**  About to head to bed.  Got a basic map showing up that looks kinda like caves, started playing around with movement, too.  I've got the basic map aware of above and below-water.

I need to get movement working better.  Right now, you can just press arrows and you move in that direction.  Rockets would be better.  I'm also tempted to disable gravity altogether under the water.  I'm twiddling against the global gravity, but that seems like it might be a dumb idea.  For a hack-job, it should be fine.

I also need to hook up power-ups and get some kind of overall goal going.  Right now the idea is that you'll need to explore your environment, dig through rock and try to find a bunch of macguffins to reach the very bottom.

Oh!  And art!  I'm hoping to use Pixatronic for that.  We'll see!  I tried making a little submarine last night in it, and a lot of the limitations and rough edges are making themselves really obvious.  I guess that's a little bit of good news and some bad, too.
