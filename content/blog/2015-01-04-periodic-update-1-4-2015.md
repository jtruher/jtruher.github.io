My god.  Three weeks?  Sooner or later the novelty'll wear off.

Had a reasonably productive week dredging through very, very crummy old code.  Panic Attack's in not-awful shape!  The Dungeon is...coming along.  One thing I'm going to have to spend some time fighting with is the general style.  I did the in-game borders in Photoshop last time.  I don't want to do that again, because it was a massive nightmare.

This time I've got a lot more experience under my belt to maybe drop some of the assets for that.  A simpler UI might be okay post-iOS 7.  Fingers crossed.

Once I get off my butt, Panic Attack'll get updated.  I've got some Game Center deprecations to handle and maybe a tile style or two - heck, maybe even a new song!

The Dungeon is gonna take a fair bit more time than that.  I'm finally dealing with all of the old, terrible code smell.  Cripes, it's bad.  At least I did some work when the Obj-C literals stuff happened.  Thank goodness for that.
