<p>So, Summer 2013, I played around a little bit with <a href="/blog/2013/08/02/waterfight-pre-mortem/">this</a> - just a little territory control game with levels built with cellular automata and a neat little colors system based off of slight shifts in saturation and brightness.  This was originally from a silly little Ludum Dare entry, but that&rsquo;s neither here nor there.</p>
<p>I used this little trick in a few other places.  Panic Attack&rsquo;s background has a little variation, as does Pixatronic, though sans lines drawn in.  It&rsquo;s great for adding a little noise and texture without breaking off from the relatively flat, clean look that iOS7 is inflicting on everyone.</p>
<p>So, as a kind of joke a few weeks ago, I thought, self, let&rsquo;s make an <em>actual</em> wallpaper with our silly little algorithms.  So I did that!  And once I did, I realized, hey, these aren&rsquo;t actually that bad.  So I made a few more.  It started as just squares, but quickly moved to triangles and diamonds and hexagons and. . .wowsers.  After a few hours of hacking and twiddling, it was actually making some pretty neat, usable, dare I say it attractive things.</p>

  <img src="/img/wallpaper-2.png"  class="left"  style="border-radius: 8px; float:left; margin: 10px; width:320px;height:0px;"  />


<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>So I kept at it.  Maybe 24 hours, wall-clock time later, I actually had something that a few people wanted to play around with which, well, is why I&rsquo;m here!  I think my wallpaper silliness (yes, that is the actual project name) is pretty much done, so I&rsquo;m gonna put up some screenshots.  This&rsquo;ll be free with silly IAP, but no limits on saving or making wallpapers.  I haven&rsquo;t decided on the full list of sliders and modifiers yet, but I&rsquo;m getting pretty close to calling it good.</p>
<p>I hope people like using it!  I&rsquo;m already using some of the stuff it&rsquo;s spit out, so I figure that&rsquo;s a pretty good sign already.  And, hey, if people really seem to like it, I&rsquo;d be tempted to do an OS X port.  Shoot.  Never done that before, have I?</p>
