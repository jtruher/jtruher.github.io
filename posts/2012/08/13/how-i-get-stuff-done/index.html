        <p>I&rsquo;ve been meaning to write this for awhile, mostly because I find it interesting seeing how other people work and figured someone might find this useful.  I actually keep my task list, for the most part, in a physical journal, written with an actual pen (a fountain pen, because that&rsquo;s just how I roll).  It&rsquo;s a system I&rsquo;ve been fumbling with for almost a decade now, and it&rsquo;s absolutely not perfect yet, but it&rsquo;s certainly good enough for right now.</p>
<p>I pretty much do all of my todo listing and heavy thinking in a little journal.  I&rsquo;m always tempted by technical solutions, like the many, many todo list apps on iOS and OS X, but I feel like they&rsquo;ll let me do too much, too quickly.  I need something that&rsquo;ll slow me down and force me to think hard, rather than something that&rsquo;ll just let me spew thoughts uncontrollably.  Often, in the course of writing down what I have to do, I&rsquo;ll actually figure out how the hell to do it, too.  It&rsquo;s rare, but still counts as bonus awesome.</p>
<p>This, sadly, leads to a bit of angst every 3-6 months when I start to get dissatisfied with the system.  The biggest bummer, at the moment, is that if my notebook isn&rsquo;t here, I can&rsquo;t really record anything for later, which is why I&rsquo;ve also started using Elements on iPhone and having it poke into nvALT&rsquo;s text directory, which syncs to Dropbox.  It isn&rsquo;t bad for little notes, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s good for much else than jotting down quick notes for later digestion.</p>
<p>My favorite pen/ink combination, thus far, is also the first pen I tried.  It&rsquo;s a boring Lamy Safari, in charcoal, with a black EF nib.  Because it&rsquo;s not black enough, I also use Sailor Nano black ink, which is an incredibly dark, durable ink.  It also flows really well, though has a tendency to clog on thinner, crappier pens.</p>
<p>My journal of choice, because I&rsquo;m a dipshit, are those trendy, floofy moleskine journals from various reputable retailers.  I like the graph paper ones for general project tracking and todo listing, and the plain ones for when I. . .don&rsquo;t really want lines.  They&rsquo;re better for drawing, too.  Their paper is plenty good for my needs, I like the feel of them, and it&rsquo;s a cheap thrill to see the finished ones lined up, all nice and neat on my shelf.</p>
<p>Every once in awhile, I flip through old journals, but that&rsquo;s a different post.</p>
