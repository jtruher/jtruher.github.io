        <p>I finished another <a href="http://itch.io/jam/simple">jam</a>, this time making <a href="http://jtruher.itch.io/oneshot">oneshot</a>!</p>
<h4 id="what-is-it">What Is It<a href="#what-is-it" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>It&rsquo;s a little arena-y shooter thing, I guess?  2-4 people jump around in a little room and try to shoot each other.  Everyone only gets one bullet before having to scramble for another one.</p>
<h4 id="what-went-right">What Went Right<a href="#what-went-right" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p><em>Finished!</em>  It&rsquo;s done, and playable, and doesn&rsquo;t seem to blow up!  Kudos, me.</p>
<p><em>Simple!</em>  I stuck to the bounds of the theme, once again bolstered by a technical, rather than creative, limitation.</p>
<h4 id="what-maybe-kinda-didnt-go-great">What Maybe Kinda Didn&rsquo;t Go Great<a href="#what-maybe-kinda-didnt-go-great" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p><em>Music!</em>  Specifically, the lack thereof.  This is usually one of the things I leave until the very end, and in this case, it bit me a little.  I had a few beats going, but most of it was pretty godawful.  Here, no music was far better than the noise I was making</p>
<p><em>Stages!</em>  Because of the limitations of the jam (5 assets, no more) I wanted to set up a bunch of different levels on just one Tiled map, using camera position to set whatever &lsquo;stage&rsquo; is presently in use.  That would&rsquo;ve taken more UI and more smarts around picking that stage, though, so it got punted as well.</p>
<p><em>Playtesting!</em>  Man, this really didn&rsquo;t happen.  Turns out, making a multiplayer game is hard if you&rsquo;re not throwing it at people to poke at.  For all I know, this is actually pretty fun, but I haven&rsquo;t found out yet.</p>
<p><em>Juice!</em>  I know, I know, this is kind of falling out of fashion, but it really could do with a bit more zazz.  Maybe particles that fly out when you jump, or screenshake when you zap a fool.  Something!  It could use a lot more stuff filling in the cracks.</p>
<h4 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts<a href="#final-thoughts" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h4>
<p>This one&rsquo;s kinda tricky.</p>
<p>I think I liked the idea way more before I started fiddling with it.  It started out as a kind of dual-stick shooter with only one stick: aiming was based on the direction of travel.  I wasn&rsquo;t sure that this&rsquo;d be all that much fun to play, as it seemed like you&rsquo;d be jousting, or something along those lines.  You end up hoping to be pointed in the right direction, and that didn&rsquo;t sound too fun.</p>
<p>Instead, you&rsquo;re just kind of hoping to have a clear horizontal line of sight with an enemy when you pew pew a laser.  I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s better, but it seems a lot simpler in terms of demands on the player.  Different maps would likely help a lot in this situation, as would bigger maps.  If I end up spinning more on this, it&rsquo;ll be one of the first things I try, along with a lot of playtesting.</p>
<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m pretty happy with it.  Moving feels kinda goofy and fun, at least playing on a keyboard.  Gamepad might be way more frustrating.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad I did it, which is probably a good sign!</p>
