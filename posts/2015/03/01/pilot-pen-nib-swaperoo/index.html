        <p>Ages ago, I had a post about pens!  (Hah.  Post.  Pens.  Moving on.)  I had two surprises from that, revolving around the Pilot pens - specifically, the Metropolitan and the Penmanship.  One&rsquo;s a fairly classic black, with pretty great weight to it, and the other is this odd clear plastic thing with grip-ridges and an odd cap.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re both pretty good pens, and especially at their prices, but I was always disappointed with how thick the Fine nib was in the Metropolitan.  I like to put down a really, really thin line because my writing is cramped and my handwriting isn&rsquo;t all that neat.  Thin means I get to be a bit sloppy, so between the two pens, the Penmanship really won out.</p>
<p>That was pretty much the end of it until a week or two ago, when I started looking into nibs.  Why couldn&rsquo;t I put an EF into the Metro?  Turns out, there was nothing but fear stopping me - and another Penmanship.  I didn&rsquo;t even bother searching, though knew that you could yank it out of a Penmanship and do a swap that way.  Which, actually, is exactly what I did.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the shoot-the-Cacodemon-until-it-dies tip: wrap the nib and feed (the black thing with ridges) in tape to yank it out.  I used packing tape, because the nib only extends about halfway down.  Yep, just wrap that thing and give &lsquo;er a tug.  Be careful and gentle when unwrapping, repeat, then discover that the nibs just kinda fit into place.  Sliding it back on was pretty straightforward too, and just took a little bit of force.</p>
<p>This is filed under &ldquo;lol who cares&rdquo; to just about everyone, but damn, I&rsquo;m happy with this pen now.  Dang, I never did end up doing that post about ink, did I?  Spoiler alert: I put Montblanc Blue/Black ink in there.  Puts down this really nice darkish-gray line.  It was my go-to black before I got this other ink, but that&rsquo;s for another post!</p>
