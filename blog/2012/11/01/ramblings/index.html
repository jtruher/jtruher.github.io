        <p>A few months after my son was born (this would have been September, 2011), circumstances dictated that my office become a guest bedroom once more.  This really was a great thing, because it meant that the person occupying it was helping life not devolve into some kind of horror flick.  An interesting side-effect was that I moved my laptop into the kitchen and did most of my fun work there (the 2.0 update for TD, at the time).</p>
<p>This also meant that I did a fair bit of writing, too.  I actually really enjoy it, partly as a means of expressing and organizing my scattered thoughts, and partly as a measure of &ldquo;things made&rdquo;.  I like making things, and I&rsquo;m slowly starting to believe that the more things I make, the better I&rsquo;ll be at making them.</p>
<p>Back to writing, though.  I played around briefly - three or four days, at most - on <a href="http://www.750words.com">750words.com</a>, and actually really enjoyed the experience.  Spending fifteen minutes to write 750 words was incredibly cathartic, especially given how much work-related stress I was under at the time.  It made me want to write more, which ended up making writing circle back around to a source of guilt instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilt?!&rdquo; you say.  &ldquo;How can this possibly make you feel guilty?&rdquo;  Well, you see, I don&rsquo;t do it.  I can sit down at my desk and not write shit.  That&rsquo;s where I program, you see, or browse reddit, or do any number of things that aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;write some goddamned prose, you monkey.&rdquo;  And, yet, this is being written, right now!  How can that be?!</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;m at the kitchen table right now.  Obviously.</p>
