        <p>This week was pretty slow.  Most of it was spent fiddling and playing around with luxe and trying different things out.  It&rsquo;s going pretty well, and - hilariously enough - my first sample projects are rebuilding old stuff.  I&rsquo;m starting with bullet heck.</p>

<p>Not really pictured, here, are a few of the things I&rsquo;m still wrapping my head around.  Input works pretty well with just the keyboard, but it might take a bit of effort to get playing nicely on mobile.  The mothership-esque thing also rotates to face the player, which is neat.</p>
<p>The good news with all of this fiddling is that I think I&rsquo;ll be ready in two weeks (yikes) for the next Ludum Dare.  I&rsquo;m getting pretty excited!</p>
<p>The other thing I did was play with a few more generators for wallomatic and try to re-integrate the blurring stuff.  I found some information about how to do a good blur, so I can at least tell if I&rsquo;m getting the &lsquo;right&rsquo; answer.  Still not sure it&rsquo;ll ship with blur, but at least I&rsquo;ve got one problem knocked out.  Basically, computer blur is dumb, and you&rsquo;ll end up with black bands, rather than the averaged color.  Obviously, this is bad if you want something to look good.</p>
