        <p>I’ve been thinking about writing on here more, which is a thing I think about often and then never actually do anything about.</p>
<p>Oops.</p>
<p>The fact that it’s an ongoing concern is a more interesting part, and maybe the whys behind that, too.  It’s neat looking back at the nonsense, and knowing I have basically zero audience means that I’m doing it just for me, which is kind of great from an intrinsic motivational perspective.</p>
<p>But that’s all really just noodling and waffling.  One thing I’m realizing is that I don’t know why I have this site anymore - it doesn’t really have a purpose, partly because it was never very well defined, and partly because any purpose it may have had has long since evaporated thanks to lack of use.  Neglect is freeing, though, because at this point I can do whatever the hell I want with it.</p>
<p>So one of the things I’m going to start doing, I think, are little mini-reviews: things that are too long for a tweet, because those stupid 12/42 tweet lists are a little nuts, and because I might as well try to write more.  Reviews are a little bonkers, so this’ll is more like blathering and rambling.</p>
